# About the book

## A brief history of this book

In 2015 I was introduced to the clean architecture by Roberto Ciatti, who is the first person I have to acknowledge for this book. I started working with him following a strict TDD approach and learning or better understanding many things I consider pillars of my programming knowledge now.

The project unfortunately was later cancelled, but the clean architecture ideas stuck in my mind, so I revisited them and used them for a simple open source project I started working on at the time [^punch]. Meanwhile I bought and read a copy of "Object Oriented Software Engineering: A Use-Case Driven Approach" by Ivar Jacobson[^ivar-jacobson-book].

In 2013 I started writing a personal blog, [The Digital Cat](http://blog.thedigitalcatonline.com/), and after having published many Python-related posts I began working on a post that would show other programmers the beauty of the clean architecture concepts. This post is "Clean Architectures in Python: a step by step example", published in 2016, and it was well received by the Python community. For a couple of years I considered expanding the post, but I couldn't find the time to do it, and in the meanwhile I realised that many things I wrote had to be corrected, clarified, or simply updated.

When I finally began doing it I also realised that other posts that I wrote could clarify parts of the methodology used in developing a project based on the clean architecture, like the introductions to TDD. So I thought that maybe a book could be the best way to present the whole picture in a proper way, and from that moment I started working on what you are reading now.

This book is the product of many hours spent thinking, experimenting, studying, and making mistakes. I couldn't have written it without the help of many people, some of whom I don't even know, who provided free documentation, free software, free help.

This is why this book comes for free. Download it, use it, and if you find mistakes please open an issue. I plan to release new versions of the book and those will be available for free as well.

Errors... There will be many, be warned. I'm not a native English speaker and I can't afford a proof reader, since I'm not planning to earn much from the book. If things will go in a different way on that side, obviously, I will consider having it reviewed by a professional. For the time being I can only apologise in advance for my mistakes and hope they will not prevent you to enjoy the book and use it effectively.

## How this book is structured

This book is divided in three parts.

The first part is about **Test-driven Development (TDD)**, a programming technique that will help you to create software which is more reliable and easier to modify. I will first guide you through a **very simple example** (chapter 1), demonstrating how to use TDD to approach a project, and how to properly create tests from requirements. I will then discuss unit testing from a more theoretical point of view, categorising functions and their tests (chapter 2). Chapter 3 will introduce **mocks**, a powerful tool that helps testing complex scenarios. Last, chapter 4 contains exercises and solutions.

The second part introduces **the clean architecture**. The first chapter discusses briefly the **components** and the ideas behind this software structure, while chapter 2 runs through *a concrete example* of a clean architecture for a very simple Web service. Chapter 3 discusses **error management** and improvements to the Python code developed in the previous chapter.

The third part shows how the **Gaudi** library works, and how it can simplify creating a clean architecture in Python. The first chapter discusses the **components of the library**, while chapter 2 analyses a **full project** built using the library.

## Why this book comes for free

The first reason I started writing a technical blog was to share with others my discoveries, and to save them the hassle of going through processes I already cracked. Moreover, I always enjoy the fact that explaining something makes me better understand that topic, and writing requires a great deal of study to get things clear in my mind, before attempting to introduce other people to the subject.

Much of what I know comes from personal investigations, but without the work of people who shared their knowledge for free I would not have gone that far. The Free Software Movement didn't start with Internet, and I got a taste of it during the 80s and the 90s, but the World Wide Web undeniably gave an impressive boost to the speed and quality of this knowledge sharing.

So this book is a way to say thanks to everybody gave part of their time for free to write blog posts, free books, software, and to organise conferences, groups, meetups. This is why I teach people at conferences, this is why I write a technical blog, this is why I created this book for free.

That said, if you want to acknowledge the effort with money feel free to do it. I'm obviously incurring expenses to publish the book or to travel to conferences, so any help is welcome. But the best thing you can do is to become part of this process of shared knowledge. Experiment, learn and share what you learn.

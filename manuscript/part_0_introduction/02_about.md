# A brief history of this book

In 2015 I was introduced to the clean architecture by Roberto Ciatti, whom goes the first TODO for this work. I started working with him following a strict TDD approach and learning or better understanding many things I consider pillars of my programming knowledge now.

The project unfortunately was later cancelled, but the clean architecture ideas stuck to my mind TODO, so I revisited them and used them for a simple open source project I started working on at the time (Note: punch). Meanwhile I bought and read a copy of TODO.

In 2013 I startedTODO writing on a personal blog, The Digital Cat, and after having published many Python-related posts I began working on a post that would show other programmers the beauty of the clean architecture concepts. This post is "Clean Architectures in Python: a step by step example", published in 2016, and it was well received by the Python community. For a couple of years I considered expanding the post, but I couldn't find the time to do it, and in the meanwhile I realised that many things I wrote had to be corrected, clarified, or simply updated.

When I finally began doing it I also realised that other posts that I wrote could clarify parts of the methodology used in developing a project based on the clean architecture, like the introductions to TDD. So I thought that maybe a book could be the best way to present the whole picture in a proper way, and from that moment I started working on what you are reading now.

This book is the product of many hours spent thinking, experimenting, studying, and making mistakes. I couldn't have written it without the help of many people, some of whom I don't even know, who provided free documentation, free software, free help.

This is why this book comes for free. Download it, use it, and if you find mistakes please open an issue. I plan to release new versions of the book and those will be available for free as well.

Errors... There will be many, be warned. I'm not a native English speaker and I can't afford a proof reader, since I'm not planning to earn much from the book. If things will go in a different way on that side, obviously, I will consider having it reviewed by a professional. For the time being I can only apologise in advance for my mistakes and hope they will not prevent you to enjoy the book and use it effectively.

# About the book

## A brief history of this book

In 2015 I was introduced to the clean architecture by Roberto Ciatti, who is the first person it's my pleasure to acknowledge for this book. I started working with him following a strict TDD approach and learning or better understanding many things I consider pillars of my programming knowledge now.

Unfortunately the project was cancelled, but the clean architecture concepts stuck with me, so I revisited them for a simple open source project I started working on at the time [^punch]. Meanwhile I read a copy of "Object Oriented Software Engineering: A Use-Case Driven Approach" by Ivar Jacobson[^ivar-jacobson-book].

In 2013 I started writing a personal blog, [The Digital Cat](http://blog.thedigitalcatonline.com/), and after having published many Python-related posts I began working on a post to show other programmers the beauty of the clean architecture concepts: "Clean Architectures in Python: a step by step example", published in 2016, which was well received by the Python community. For a couple of years I considered expanding the post, but I couldn't find the time to do it, and in the meanwhile I realised that many things I had written needed to be corrected, clarified, or simply updated.

I also saw that other posts of mine could clarify parts of the methodology used in developing a project based on the clean architecture, such as the introduction to TDD. So I thought that a book could be the best way to present the whole picture effectively, and here we are.

This book is the product of many hours' thinking, experimenting, studying, and making mistakes. I couldn't have written it without the help of many people, some of whose names I don't know, who provided free documentation, free software, free help.

This is why this book comes for free. Download it, use it, and if you find mistakes please open an issue. I plan to release new versions of the book and those will be available for free as well.

Errors: be aware there will be many. I'm not a native English speaker and a friend kindly proofread the opening, less technical chapters, for free, trying to mitigate the worst errors. In the future I may consider having it reviewed by a professional. For now I can only apologise in advance for my mistakes and hope you will nevertheless enjoy the book and be able to use it effectively.

## How this book is structured

This book is divided into TODO parts.

The first part is about **Test-driven Development (TDD)**, a programming technique that will help you more reliable and easily modifiable software. I will first guide you through a **very simple example** (chapter 1), demonstrating how to use TDD to approach a project, and how to properly create tests from requirements. I will then discuss unit testing from a more theoretical point of view, categorising functions and their tests (chapter 2). Chapter 3 will introduce **mocks**, a powerful tool that helps to test complex scenarios.

The second part introduces **the clean architecture**. The first chapter discusses briefly the **components** and the ideas behind this software structure, while chapter 2 runs through **a concrete example** of clean architecture for a very simple Web service. Chapter 3 discusses **error management** and improvements to the Python code developed in the previous chapter.

## Why this book comes for free

The first reason I started writing a technical blog was to share with others my discoveries, and to save them the hassle of going through processes I had already cracked. Moreover, I always enjoy the fact that explaining something forces me to better understand that topic, and writing requires even more study to get things clear in my mind, before attempting to introduce other people to the subject.

Much of what I know comes from personal investigations, but without the work of people who shared their knowledge for free I would not have been able to make much progress. The Free Software Movement didn't start with Internet, and I got a taste of it during the 80s and 90s, but the World Wide Web undeniably gave an impressive boost to the speed and quality of this knowledge sharing.

So this book is a way to say thanks to everybody gave part of their time for free to write blog posts, free books, software, and to organise conferences, groups, meetups. This is why I teach people at conferences, this is why I write a technical blog, this is why I created this book for free.

That said, if you want to acknowledge the effort with money, feel free. Anyone who publishes a book or travels to conferences is incurring expenses, and any help is welcome. However the best thing you can do is to become part of this process of shared knowledge; experiment, learn and share what you learn.

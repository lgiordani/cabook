## How to use this chapter

Methodologies cannot be learned just by reading their description on a book. You have to practice them. Thus, you should avoid as much as possible to just follow this chapter reading the code. Instead, you should try to write the code and to try new solutions to the problems that I discuss.

 your own code and then compare it with the solution I give (which, by the way, is not guaranteed to be the best one).

The first sections of the chapter guide you through the setup of the project and describe the requirements of the software we are going to develop. After those you have each single step of the project in a separate section. Each step has been formatted to help you to follow the process: there is a description, a test, and a solution. 

My advice is to follow everything included the whole first step. This step introduces you to the TDD process, and shows you how to read the output returned by Pytest. Copy and paste the code, check that everything works in your system like shown here.

After this you can follow the rest of the steps reading the description and copying the test. You should, however, try to implement yourself the code that makes the test suite pass. This is very important, as it actually makes you use TDD. This way at the end of the chapter you will have a personal experience of what TDD is like.
